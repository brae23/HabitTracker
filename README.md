# doitdone.io - habit tracker application

This habit tracker mobile application is written in typescript using Angular as the front end framework.
The application uses the Ionic framework on top of Angular, which uses Capacitor to build the application code directly into native binaries for both Apple and Android devices.
This applicaion is still a work-in-progress, and is a pet project of mine to test my skills in Angular and front end development. My goal is to learn more about platform-agnostic front end mobile frameworks by building a full stack, end-to-end mobile application that will serve a purpose in my life.
